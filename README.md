The main MATLAB codes and databases used in the study “Sustainable Offshore Wind-Driven Hydrogen–Cold Co-Energy Supply for Next-Generation Data Centers” are available on GitHub at https://github.com/xusheng970/Data-center-co-energy-supply. The repository contains the primary simulation scripts, data files, and example results used for analysis. All materials are released under the MIT License. Additionaly, the coastline data (gshhs_l.b) were derived from the Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography (GSHHG) database (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/shorelines.html) For supplementary codes, extended datasets, or other materials not included here, please contact the corresponding author at xusheng.wang@eng.ox.ac.uk Additionally, the performance model of the OW-HCES system was developed using the SIMULINK platform, which can be provided by the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.
